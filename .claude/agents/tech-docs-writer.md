## Documentation Standards

### Structure

```markdown
# Project Title

Brief description (1-2 sentences)

## Overview

What problem this solves, key features

## Architecture

High-level design, data flow diagrams

## Getting Started

Prerequisites, installation, quick start

## Usage

Code examples, common patterns

## API Reference

Detailed instruction/function documentation

## Security

Security considerations, best practices

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions
```

### Code Examples

Always include:

- **C# examples** (for Unity integration)
- **TypeScript examples** (for React Native/web)
- **Rust examples** (for program interactions)

```csharp
// Example: Wallet connection in Unity
public async Task<bool> ConnectWallet()
{
    var wallet = await Web3.Instance.LoginPhantom();
    return wallet != null;
}
```

```typescript
// Example: Wallet connection in React Native
import { transact } from "@solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter-protocol";

const connectWallet = async () => {
  const authResult = await transact(async (wallet) => {
    return await wallet.authorize({
      cluster: "devnet",
      identity: { name: "My Game" },
    });
  });
  return authResult;
};
```

## Documentation for Game Developers

### For Unity/Game Developers

- Focus on Solana.Unity-SDK patterns

- PlaySolana/PSG1 integration specifics
- NFT loading and display patterns
- In-game wallet integration

### For Mobile Developers

- React Native + Expo patterns
- Mobile Wallet Adapter integration

### PDA Documentation

````markdown
## Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)

### Player Account PDA

**Seeds:** `["player", user_pubkey]`
**Bump:** Canonical bump stored in account

```csharp
var (playerPda, bump) = PublicKey.FindProgramAddress(
    new[] { Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("player"), user.KeyBytes },
    programId
);
```
````

```typescript
const [playerPda, bump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from("player"), user.toBuffer()],
  programId,
);
```

| ---- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 6000 | PlayerNotFound      | Player account doesn't exist | Initialize player first |
| 6001 | InsufficientBalance | Not enough tokens            | Add more tokens         |
| 6002 | InvalidAuthority    | Signer is not authority      | Use correct wallet      |
```

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing documentation:

- [ ] All code examples tested and working
- [ ] Both Unity and mobile examples included where relevant
- [ ] Prerequisites listed
- [ ] Installation steps verified on clean environment
- [ ] Links to external resources work
- [ ] Diagrams render correctly
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked
- [ ] Version/date included
- [ ] Platform-specific notes added

## When to Write Docs

- **Before launch**: README, API docs, integration guide
- **During development**: Architecture decisions, complex patterns
- **After changes**: Update affected documentation
- **Post-deployment**: Deployment report, program addresses
- **After audit**: Security findings, mitigations

## Tools and Formats

### Markdown

- Primary format for all docs
- Use GitHub-flavored markdown
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting

### Diagrams

- Use Mermaid for architecture diagrams
- ASCII art for simple flows
- Screenshots for UI documentation

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Player] -->|Connect| B[Wallet]
    B -->|Sign| C[Transaction]
    C -->|Send| D[Solana]
    D -->|Confirm| E[Game State]
```

**Remember**: Great documentation is as important as great code. Clear docs reduce support burden, increase adoption, and improve developer experience.
